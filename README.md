# Product Recommendation System
This Python project is a powerful product-based recommendation engine designed to boost customer engagement and drive business growth. By analyzing user behavior, product features, and purchase history, it delivers personalized product suggestions. 


This repository contains a recommendation engine developed using two techniques:

- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** - A matrix factorization method for extracting latent features.
- **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** - A popular recommendation technique based on user-item interactions.

The goal of this recommendation system is to predict products a user may be interested in by analyzing past behavior and similar users' interactions with products.

### Key Features
- **Product Recommendations**: Suggests products based on user preferences.
- **SVD and CF Algorithms**: Implements both matrix factorization (SVD) and collaborative filtering techniques for generating recommendations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics like recall to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.

### Workflow

The following diagram represents the workflow of the recommender system:

![Workflow Diagram](documentation/workflow.svg)

Before going into explaination of this workflow lets fetch the git repository containing code and prepare the enviornment.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Conda installed. If you donâ€™t have it yet, you can download it from [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or install it via Miniconda.


**Step 1: Create a Conda Environment**

To set up a clean environment with all necessary dependencies, you can create a new Conda environment.

Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
conda create -n product-recommendation python=3.8
conda activate product-recommendation
```

This will create a new Conda environment named `product-recommendation` with Python 3.8 installed and activate the environment.

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Once the environment is activated, install the required dependencies from environment.yml.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
**Step 3: Clone the Repository**

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umushtaq1990/product-recommendation-engine.git

cd product-recommendation-engine
```

Now, your environment is set up and ready for use.

e.g: If evaluaton data
contain 100 users,
those 100 users are
checked for
recommendations
generated
by different models 
by taking into account
top n recommended
results.If 70 users
newly taken product matches with
recommended results, recall
score for that model
will be 0.7
